				<h2>Isolate your hardware from your software</h2>
				<p>Circuit Check runs alongside your project's running code. This helps you see what's happening while it's happening! But it can be hard to see if buggy system behavior is being caused by an error your code or your hardware. By hitting the pause button, you can temporarily stop your code from executing and test to make sure your hardware is able to work correctly. No need to wonder if its hardware or software problems, use Circuit Check to pause your code and check your hardware.</p>
