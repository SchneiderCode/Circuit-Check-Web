				<h2>View live sensor data</h2>
				<p>No longer do you need to add in large blocks of formatted print statements to see what's happening in your system! With Circuit Check you can easily observe any of your onboard or connected sensors, quickly switching from a live readout from a light sensor to checking on a button.</p>

				<h2>Test hardware components</h2>
				<p>Need to check if an LED will turn on/off? Want to test your piezo speakers to find the perfect frequency? Circuit Check enables you to iterate over all the different settings for your hardware, so you can both verify that your components work and find the perfect setting for your project.</p>

				<h2>Isolate hardware from software</h2>
				<p>At first glance, it can be hard to tell what's causing buggy system behavior. Is an LED not turning on because of a bug in your code or hardware? With Circuit Check, there's no need to wonder if its hardware or software problems! By hitting the pause button, you can halt your running program and quickly check your hardware is functioning correctly. For example, you can toggle the LED on/off to ensure it's able to work without worrying about your code modifying its state.</p>
