				<h2>View live sensor data</h2>
				<p>No longer do you need to add in large blocks of formatted print statements to see what's happening in your system! With Circuit Check you can check on any of your onboard or connected sensors, easily switching from a live readout for a light sensor to checking on a button.</p>

				<h2>Test hardware components</h2>
				<p>Need to check if an LED will turn on/off or maybe find just the right frequency for your piezo pekaers? Circuit check enables you to try out a multitude of different states for hardware components, so you can both test that they work and find the perfect setting for your project.</p>

				<h2>Isolate your hardware from your software</h2>
				<p>Circuit Check runs alongside your project's running code. This helps you see what's happening while it's happening! But it can be hard to see if buggy system behavior is being caused by an error your code or your hardware. By hitting the pause button, you can temporarily stop your code from executing and test to make sure your hardware is able to work correctly. No need to wonder if its hardware or software problems, use Circuit Check to pause your code and check your hardware.</p>
